# Algorithms, Part I
This repo contains implementations for all data structures and associated
algorithms that I have learnt from [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
on Coursera.

The implementations are in two languages - _Java_ and _Python3_, for the sake of practice
and understanding of the core concepts.
